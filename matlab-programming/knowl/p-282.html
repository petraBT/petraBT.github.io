<p>The multiplication of matrices in linear algebra is not quite as straight-forward as the addition and subtraction are. If you have never heard of matrix multiplication before then it may be helpful for you to quickly watch a few YouTube videos to get up to speed. Matrix multiplication is not an essential skill in this class but it'll help to put what comes next in context. Also, you'll need to familiarize yourself with matrix multiplication for future classes, so you might just as well get started now.</p>
