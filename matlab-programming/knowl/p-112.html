<div class="para">MATLAB is an interactive system whose basic data element is an array that does not require dimensioning. This allows you to solve many technical computing problems, especially those with matrix and vector formulations, in a fraction of the time it would take to write a program in a scalar non-interactive language such as C or Fortran. We will see that MATLAB can simply perform operations on all elements of an array at the same time, without us having to write several loops to advance through the individual matrix elements.</div>
