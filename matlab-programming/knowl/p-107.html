<div class="para">With the C programming language we found that there were very few built-in functions. Anything we wanted to accomplish we had to program by ourselves. Using pointers and other such strategies we can work directly with the computer's memory. We are therefore programming “close to the hardware”. Programming languages that allow working close to the hardware are also referred to as low level languages. One can, therefore, write code that is very portable (simply pass your C-program to someone else and as long as they have a C-compiler they can compile your code into an executable program). You can also create your own user-defined libraries to provide additional features.</div>
