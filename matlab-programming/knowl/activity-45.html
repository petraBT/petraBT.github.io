<em class="emphasis">Challenge</em>: Plot the Mandelbrot set.</div> <div class="para">The Mandelbrot set is a subset of the complex plane (or the xy-plane) determined as follows: To check whether a point (x,y) (corresponding to the complex number <span class="process-math">\(c = x+iy\)</span>) belongs to the Mandelbrot set, one carries out the following calculation repeatedly (this is called iteration), starting with <span class="process-math">\(z=0\text{:}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
z_{new} = z^2 + c
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Thus, the following calculations are performed:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
z_1 = c; \;\; z_2 = z_1^2 +c = c^2 + c; \;\; z_3 = z_2^2 + c = (c^2 + c)^2 + c; ...
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">To find out whether the point c belongs to the Mandelbrot set one checks whether the sequence of z-values generated above stays inside the circle of radius 2 or not. Of course we’d have to look at all (infinitely many) z-values to be sure, but performing the first 100 iterations gives us a pretty good idea. After having calculated <span class="process-math">\(z_{100}\)</span> we thus ask the following:</div> <div class="para">Is <span class="process-math">\(z_{100}\)</span> inside the circle of radius 2, i.e. is its absolute value less than 2? If the answer is:</div> <ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">yes, then color the point c black (these are the points c that belong to the Mandelbrot set)</div></li>
<li><div class="para">no, then color the point c white (or another color of your choice)</div></li>
</ul> <div class="para">A good rectangle of c-values to look at is the one with real parts between -2.25 and 1.75 and imaginary parts between -1.5 and 1.5. You want to divide this viewing rectangle up into individual “pixels”, something like 800 by 600. The best way to do so is to have two 800x600 arrays - one for the x-values and one for the y-values. You can then simply create all c-values that you are interested in via <span class="process-math">\(c = x+i*y\)</span> (Matlab knows complex numbers!). You can ‘fill’ these arrays by hand (using a loop), or by using the Matlab <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">meshgrid</code> command.</div> <div class="para">Next you carry out the iteration: You can initialize z as an array of zeros of the same size as your array of c-values, then use a for loop to update <span class="process-math">\(z = z^2 + c\)</span> 100 times.</div> <div class="para">Now assign the value 1 to those points that have escaped the circle of radius 2, and the value 2 to those that have remained within (these are the points in the Mandelbrot set). You can display this image using the Matlab <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">image</code> command. You’ll have to define a colormap (one with exactly two colors in it), for example via</div> <div class="code-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><pre class="program"><code class="language-matlab">blackwhite = [1 1 1;0 0 0];
colormap(blackwhite)
</code></pre></div> <div class="para">if you do want to use the two colors white (rgb 1 1 1) and black (rgb 0 0 0).</div> <div class="para"><em class="emphasis">Please enter your solution (ONE per group - please identify group number) into the textbox.</em></div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="functions-practice2.html#activity-45" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
