<p>With MATLAB, we will see that there are many built-in functions. Rather than having to decide on our own how large an array will be or how much memory we might need, MATLAB takes care of all these worries for us. We won't even have to declare variables since MATLAB figures it out on its own. Such a language is also referred to as “high level”. In fact, we will see that the power of MATLAB comes from the built-in functions, graphics  capabilities, interactivity, and on-line help. There are so many built-in functions that we'll never come even close to learning about all of them.</p>
