<div class="para">Unlike C, MATLAB is an interpreted language (mostlyâ€¦). Recall that C is a compiled language. You write your code in the C-programming language in a file with the extension .c and then run this file through a C-compiler (with the help of header files that contain prototypes of functions you wish to use). This process generates an object file, which is simply the translation into machine language of your C-code. An object file by itself is not yet executable, however. The <dfn class="terminology">linker</dfn> takes the object file along with the machine-language versions of all needed libraries and bundles everything together into an executable file.</div>
