<p>When the elements of our array are stored right next to each other (as they are in the case of an array) then all the computer needs to find all of these elements is the address of the first element (and its datatype). With that information and the knowledge of how much room each element of this datatype takes up, the computer can calculate the address of subsequent elements and thereby access all of them (while it's the programmers job to keep track of the length of the array).</p>
