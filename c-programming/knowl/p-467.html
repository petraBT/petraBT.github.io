<p>We noticed in the last video that arithmetic is not straight forward in the signed magnitude representation of negative numbers. We therefore introduce a different way to store negative integers, namely the <em class="alert">binary two's complement</em> representation. While this representation may seem cumbersome at first, the point is really to fix the problems we observed with binary addition when negative numbers are involved. The binary two's complement representation allows for the same process to be used in adding integers internally inside the computer, regardless of whether the numbers are positive or negative. This process is typically hard-wired in the computer's processor which makes for super fast execution time.</p>
