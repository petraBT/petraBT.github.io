<p>We'll now introduce the concept of a variable. As mentioned earlier, you can think of a variable as a storage location with a name associated to it by which you can refer to the contents of the storage location. A fundamental aspect of working with variables in C is that you need to decide and tell the computer up front what type of data (integer, character, etc) you wish to store in it. We call this process <em class="alert">declaring</em> the variable. Furthermore, it is good practice to assign a value to a variable right at the outset (we call this <em class="alert">initializing</em>) so that your variable holds a value that you control. If you try to use a variable that has not been declared, you will receive an error message from the compiler. Using a variable that has been declared but not initialized (not assigned a value) will lead to unpredictable results.</p>
