<p>Write a C program that reads a list of first names from the file <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">"names.txt"</code> (a test file can be accessed in the coding window below if you are using our code tool - if you work on the servers directly, please simply create your own input file <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">"names.txt"</code>). For each name that you read you need to reserve space in memory using <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">malloc()</code> to store the name. To do so, you can either read the name first into a temporary variable, find its length, and then allocate the relevant memory (don't forget about the null terminator), or you may assume that no name has more than 50 characters and allocate that same amount of space for each name read. In addition to allocating space for the name read and placing the name read into that space, you also need to store the pointer to the name in an array of pointers. You may assume that there are no more than 20 names in the file.</p>
