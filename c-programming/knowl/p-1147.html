<div class="para">Normally, we won’t know how many numbers are in a file before we open it, so how do we know when to stop reading from the file? It turns out, the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">fscanf()</code> function actually tells us when we reach the end of the file via a return value of EOF. This is so important that I’ll say it again: It is the the <em class="alert">return value</em> of the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">fscanf()</code> function through which we’ll know when the end of the file has been reached. It is <em class="alert">not the value</em> that was read. This is a super common cause for confusion so be sure to ask lots of questions and make sure you understand the difference. To sum up: Instead of using a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">for</code> loop to read from the file, from now on we’ll simply keep reading until we reach the end of the file, indicated by the return value of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">EOF</code> of the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">fscanf()</code> function.</div>
