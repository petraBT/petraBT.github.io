<p>Suppose you wanted to delete the third student in a linked list of five student records. Why can’t you just free the space allocated for the third student?</p> <ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>It is impossible to delete a student from a linked list of students. That's why arrays are better than linked lists.</p></li>
<li><p>The compiler won’t let you do that.</p></li>
<li><p>By deleting the third student you'd loose access to the remaining students in the list. Instead, you'd need to link the second student to the fourth student in the list (and in order to do so, you need to know where the third student was pointing).</p></li>
<li><p>You need to use the command free instead of simply deleting the student. As long as you use free you are okay.</p></li>
