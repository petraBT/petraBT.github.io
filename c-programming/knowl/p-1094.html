<div class="para">In this chapter, we will shift our focus towards debugging our code. Errors in our code are inevitable. You have already seen lots of syntax errors most likely (don't tell me that you have never forgotten one of those semicolons...) Or your code may be logically incorrect (for example, the computer may not interpret your code in the same way as you intended). Oftentimes, we may find ourselves knowing what we want to achieve with our code, but errors or unexpected outputs hinder our success. By following some simple debugging strategies, you'll be able to find those mistakes more easily.</div>
