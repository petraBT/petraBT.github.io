<p>It's time to write all of the functions in the library! With your group, please decide which function you'd like to work on first. In order to make sure that we can get all functions covered (after all, we would like to have a working library by the end of class today), we'll use a google doc in which we keep track of who is working on what. Access to this google doc is at the bottom of this page.</p>
