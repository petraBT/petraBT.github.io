<p>We are ready to put everything together! Rather than simply storing three points that were already known at compile time, we'll now ask the user to enter the number of points they wish to store and then create space in memory at run-time for each such point. Each newly created point (other than the first one, which is the start of the list), is linked to the list by saving its address at the previous element of the list.</p>
