<p>Next, we will investigate how to switch a number of one datatype to that of another. After all, the integer 5 for example could also be written as the float 5.0. In the computer's memory, the 5 would be stored in binary 2's complement whereas the 5.0 would be stored in a totally different fashion (which we'll learn about in this lesson). We have seen that a number's datatype affects how arithmetic is performed (recall the strange division behavior in C? 5/2 = 2 but 5.0/2.0 = 1.5?) That's why it's necessary to know how to convert the datatype for example from an <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">int</code> to a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">float</code> in C. This process is called <em class="alert">casting</em>.</p>
