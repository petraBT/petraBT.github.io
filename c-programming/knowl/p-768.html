<p>We have already used one type of loop in our previous work, namely the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">for</code> loop. This type of loop requires us to know up front how many times the enclosed code is to be repeated. There are situations where this is not the case however, for example if we wanted to read integers entered by the user until the user enters a certain number that signifies that they are done. This would be quite difficult to accomplish using a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">for</code> loop. In this chapter, we'll learn about some other types of loops that are more suitable in such a situation.</p>
