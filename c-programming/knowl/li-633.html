</h2>Next, imagine that your array contains records that have been sorted by some criterion. Suppose you wanted to add a new record, and it would have to go somewhere in the middle of your array in order to maintain the sorting. You'd then have to move over all of the records that need to come after the new record in order to make room for the new record. Again, this is not a very efficient way to go about things.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="linkedlists.html#li-633" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
