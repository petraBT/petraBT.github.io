<div class="para">There are lots of different types of numbers: integers (whole numbers without any decimal places), rational numbers, irrational numbers, complex numbers, etc. No matter how large, a computer’s amount of storage has limits. You can see that therefore it would be hard to store with 100% accuracy, a number with infinitely many decimal places such as <span class="process-math">\(\pi\text{.}\)</span> Moreover, different types of numbers are dealt with in different ways internally and that’s why we discuss them separately. We start with whole numbers, also called <dfn class="terminology">integers</dfn>, or <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">int</code> for short. Integers can be positive, negative, or zero and have no digits after the decimal point.</div>
