<body class="ignore-math"><div class="solution solution-like"><div class="para">Though this task could technically be accomplished with either type of loop, a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">while</code>-loop would be more efficient to use, since you don't know how many times the user will input information before that certain "stop" integer is entered. With a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">for</code>-loop, you'd have to prescribe a certain number of iterations through the loop, but you don't know this number up front! A <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">while</code>-loop does not need to be told how many times to iterate, rather it can simply run until it finds that certain "stop" integer being entered.</div></div></body>
