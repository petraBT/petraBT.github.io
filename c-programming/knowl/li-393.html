</h3>The prototype for Linux was released in 1991, when Torvalds was 21 years old, with version 1.0 following in 1994. What Torvalds had in mind with this operating system is encapsulated well in his prototype announcement: <em class="emphasis">"Hello everybody out there using minix - I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. (...) I'll get something practical within a few months, and I'd like to know what features most people would want. Any suggestions are welcome, but I won't promise I'll implement them :-) Linus (torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi)"</em></article><span class="incontext"><a href="linux-intro.html#li-393" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
