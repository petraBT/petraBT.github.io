<body class="ignore-math"><div class="solution solution-like"><div class="para">Within any string (deliminated by double quotes <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">" "</code>), a double quote needs to be “escaped”, that is, preceded by a backslash. Single quotes are actually okay within strings, but it is also okay to escape them. If you'd like to use a single quote within something enclosed by single quotes however, then you need to escape that single quote (but double quotes are okay, surrounded by single quotes).</div></div></body>
