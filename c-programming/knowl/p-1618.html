<p>It is our job to keep track of the start, that is, the address of the first element of the list (in the image it is stored in a variable named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">start</code>). Each element knows where the next element is stored, and the last element knows that it is last. This is all the information needed to access the entire list. We'll therefore group together whatever it is we'd like to store along with an additional address field which is there to store the location of the next element. We'll typically use a structure for this purpose as is depicted in the following image:</p>
