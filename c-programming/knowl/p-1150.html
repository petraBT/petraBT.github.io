<p>In this chapter, we will take a look at how variables are stored in memory, how much space is needed to store different types of variables and the limitations that come with having a finite amount of memory yet an infinite possibility of different numbers. We will also take a closer look at what happens to variables during a function call and with that, the "scope" of variables, that is those parts of your program that can see and use your variables.</p>
