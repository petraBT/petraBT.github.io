<p><em class="alert">Roundoff error</em> is the difference between an approximation of a number used in computation and its exact (correct) value. This comes from the computer's inability to represent some numbers exactly. What may come as a bit of a surprise at first is the fact that there are some rather simple numbers that the computer can't get right when using the standard ways to store them and not just the obvious candidates such as <span class="process-math">\(\pi\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(e\text{.}\)</span> We'll see examples below and also why this is happening.</p>
