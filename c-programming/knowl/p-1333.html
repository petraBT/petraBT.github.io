<div class="para">Write a program that prompts the user to type in a sentence, and that reads the sentence, character by character, and stores it in an array of characters. Stop reading, when the array is full or the character read is <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">\n</code>. Next, print out the sentence in reverse. Your program should use two functions: one function to read from the user input the relevant sentence, and another function to print the sentence in reverse. You'll also need to think about passing along the length of the sentence entered by the user.</div>
