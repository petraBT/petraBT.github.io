<p>With our current knowledge, if we wish to store someone's name in the computer's memory we'd have to create a variable for each character in the name in order to do so. For example, to store all of the letters in “Petra” we'd need five variables of type <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">char</code> to store the individual letters, such as <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">char letter1 = 'P'</code>, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">char letter2 = 'e'</code>, ... , <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">char letter5 = 'a'</code>. This is not exactly convenient and there is a better way to do so, using a so-called <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">array</code>. An array is a collection of items of the same datatype that you can access via one variable name. We'll start by learning about one-dimensional arrays which can also be thought of as lists. In this chapter, we'll focus on such one-dimensional arrays and practice working with them. Specifically, we'll learn about:</p>
