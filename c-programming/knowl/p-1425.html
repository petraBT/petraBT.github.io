<p>Have you ever needed to sort a pile of papers into alphabetical order? There are many different ways to do so and you yourself may have a preferred method. But could you teach that method to a computer? A sorting algorithm is just that: it is an algorithm that puts elements of a list in a certain order. Most of the time we'll want to sort data numerically (from smallest to largest or from largest to smallest) or alphabetically. In order to sort small amounts of data efficiency isn't really all that important, but when lists get long then it is important to pay attention to the efficiency of the algorithms. That's why there are many different sorting algorithms that have been invented and we'll just scratch the surface and study some of the simple (and not very efficient) ones.</p>
