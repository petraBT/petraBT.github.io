<p>Sometimes, it is beneficial to group together certain pieces of data that belong together. An example is a phone book entry that consists of a name and an associated phone number. Of course we could simply store all names in one array and all associated phone numbers in a second array, but it would be more convenient to have one array whose entries consist of records that contain both the name and the associated phone number. This is what <em class="alert">structures</em> are made for. They provide a fantastic way to define your own records in a single compact variable.</p>
