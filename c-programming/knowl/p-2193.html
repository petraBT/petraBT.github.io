<div class="para">Now that we have created our own data types and functions that allow us to manipulate instances of objects of these new types it is common to package such functions as a <em class="alert">library</em>. Take as an example our arbitrarily large integers. In order to allow others to use these numbers in their code it would make sense to “hide” and package up all the work and messiness that goes into creating such a number. You'd probably even want to provide some additional functionality such as adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing two such number and then hand all that to a user who just wants to be able to work with really large numbers (but has no interest in how you implemented that functionality). That's where libraries come in.</div>
