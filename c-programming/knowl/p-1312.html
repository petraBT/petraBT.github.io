<p>Suppose you wanted to store a name (for example "Petra") in the computer's memory. Of course you could simply declare five individual characters and assign the letters of the name to them. But that's not very convenient and we already know that an array of characters would be a much better option. We could then simply use a loop to print out all of the characters one-by-one. The only slight issue would be that we'd have to keep track of the length of the name somewhere in order to be able to tell the loop how many times to run. Not a huge deal really, and we are already used to doing so for other arrays.</p>
